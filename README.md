# Ford GoBike Data Exploration
## by Ayush Mathur


### Data Visualization

Data Visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. It is used to convey trends and patterns that are hard to understand.  Patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization.

### Dataset

I chose Ford GoBike Dataset for this project. A bike-share system is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Ford GoBike is a public bicycle sharing system in San Francisco Bay Area, California. currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. As of January 2018, the system had seen nearly 500,000 rides since the launch in 2017 and had about 10,000 annual subscribers.

### Summary of Findings

During exploration,I found out that there are some specific patterns in the usage of Ford Gobike. There is quite a contrast when it comes to Summer v/s winter and Weekdays v/s Weekends. Demand timimgs seem to be affected by the office hours. Majority of the rides are for shorter distances and duration. Subscribers have most rides around July whereas customers have most rides in April. Subscribers use bikes during weekdays whereas customers use bikes more on Saturday. There is small demand even throughout the night. Few specific months were associated with more bike rides, higher mean distance travelled or longer duration trips. Age groups have had an impact on the trends. Overall mean longest trip duration in August and september is the result of sudden peak in the trip duration of teenagers during Summer. They have 3 times the duration than other age groups.
Other age groups have more or less similar trends overall. Therefore, a sudden rise or fall in teenagers trend has an impact on the overall trend. Users within the age group 30 to 40 have the highest mean distance. Average distance travelles by teenagers is less but the time spent is more. Changes in their trends in summer and winter are visible in the overall trend. Gender does not seem to have an high impact on the trend. Customer and subscriber trends vary but the data is subscriber heavy. Customer trends are not visible in overall trends. It is more or less obvious to have more subscribers using the bike service. From the peak hours and the weekly distribution of the rides, I am sure most of the commuter are regular office employees and students. Sudden change in trends during summer and decline in winter indicates vacation time.

### Key insights for presentation.

For presentation, I will focus on the monthly, weekly and hourly distribution of rides. Later on the difference in trends of Subscribers and customers. Finally, the trends of different age groups throughout the year.
