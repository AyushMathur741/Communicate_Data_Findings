Data Visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. It is used to convey trends and patterns that are hard to understand.  Patterns, trends and correlations that might go undetected in text-based data can be exposed and recognized easier with data visualization. A bike-share system is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Ford GoBike is a public bicycle sharing system in San Francisco Bay Area, California. currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. As of January 2018, the system had seen nearly 500,000 rides since the launch in 2017 and had about 10,000 annual subscribers.
